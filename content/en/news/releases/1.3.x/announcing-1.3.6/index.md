## Security update

## Bug fixes

- **Fixed** an issue where a duplicate listener was generated for the proxy's IP address when using a headless tcp service. ([Issue 17748](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/17748))
- **Improved** load-shedding options for Mixer. Added support for a `requests-per-second` threshold for load-shedding enforcement. This allows operators to turn off load-shedding for Mixer in low traffic scenarios.
- **Fixed** an issue with the `destination_service` label in HTTP related metrics incorrectly falling back to `request.host` which can cause a metric cardinality explosion for ingress traffic. ([Issue 18818](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/18818))
